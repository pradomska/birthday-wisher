# birthday-wisher

What is your solution to remember everybody's date of birth?
I'm going to build a Python program. And this Python program is going to be the automated birthday wisher. All I must to do is create a spreadsheet of all of my friend's 
birthdays and then create a bunch of emails and I'll randomly pick an email to send to each of these friends.

Eamil SMTP is a module that comes pre-bundled with Python and it helps us send email using Python code. And datetime is another Python module that helps us figure out 
what today's date is or how to format a particular date and time. And in my case, it's going to help me figure out if today happens to be the day of one of my friend's 
birthdays, in which case I'll send them a birthday email.
