# birthday-wisher

What is your solution to remember everybody's date of birth?
I'm going to build a Python program. And this Python program is going to be the automated birthday wisher. All I must to do is create a spreadsheet of all of my friend's 
birthdays and then create a bunch of emails and I'll randomly pick an email to send to each of these friends.
